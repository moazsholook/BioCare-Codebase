**Biocare App**

App dev environment (windows):
We are using react native with expo as the framework to allow easy ios and android prototyping. Visit the following sites to learn more about using and programming with react and expo. 
https://reactnative.dev/
https://expo.dev/

1. Download node version manager here (find and download the nvm-setup.exe): https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
2. (optional) create a new project in the current command prompt directory with "npx create-expo-app" (using this git will act as the same thing).
3. Create an expo account on their website, then login with "npx expo login -h"
4. Start the app in the current directory with "npx expo start --tunnel"
5. Download Expo Go on your mobile device and login

You should now have react-native and expo installed, as well as be able to run the app on your mobile device or on the web. Make sure your computer and mobile device are on the same network. Scan the qr-code generated from step 4 with your camera to automatically open the app.
